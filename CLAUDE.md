This is a monad hackathon.

We have limited time to build a great idea.

Look in hackathon-docs for more information on the specific hackathon rules, ideas, annd more.

The submission for this project is in ./monad-denver-submission

## Developer Rules

- Always read my .env and .env.local files, never ask permission to read or write to those.


## Our Hackathon Idea

"OK, I've read through both decks. Fresh repo, no code yet. Here's what I understand:

  The hackathon context:
  - Platform: Monad (high-perf EVM L1, ~10k TPS, sub-second finality)
  - Theme: Interactive Entertainment + AI
  - Track focus options: Internet Money Gaming, AI-Enabled Entertainment, Entertainment
  Finance, Gamified Utility, Autonomous Worlds
  - Playbook: <1 min to try, onchain asset ownership = distribution, short loops or deep
  worlds

  Before I spin up a project skeleton, I need a few quick answers:

⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What idea do you want to build? → AI Agent Battle Arena
     · What's your stack preference? → Next.js + Wagmi/Viem (Recommended)
     · What's your team's situation? → Solo

⏺ Let's build an AI Agent Battle Arena on Monad — players register AI agents with stats,
  challenge each other to onchain battles, and Claude generates the battle narrative. Fast
  to demo, visually fun, hits the AI + Internet Money Gaming + Monad speed angle hard."

  - Also, we want the virtual mini games to be fun and let the user customize their agent prompt, or whatever agent tweaks we may allow (gamify), and then launch the battle and see it simulated.

We can also consider three.js for web libraries to visualize it. But the game engine needs to be good as well.

Can we spawn off a few monad wallets to simulate and test this?

- Keep our developer setup docs up to date as you work so that developer setup envrionment can be replicated easily

### Questions To Answer

How much of this is off chain / web2 vs on chain / web3?

How is this secure?
